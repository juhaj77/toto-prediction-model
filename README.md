# Toto Prediction Model

A mixed neural network architecture combining **LSTM** and **Dense** layers.

- **LSTM** processes each runner’s historical race data (time-series input).
- **Dense** processes static race and runner features.
- The outputs are merged into a single predictive model.

Training data is scraped from [Veikkaus](https://www.veikkaus.fi).

## Project Structure

- `model-learning/` – Data scraping and model training  
- `ravimalli-mixed/` – Trained model artifacts  
- `front-end/` – Prediction user interface  

---

## Install

Run `npm install` in the `model-learning` and `front-end` folders.

## Data Collection

Race data is appended to:

`ravit_opetusdata.json`

⚠️ The Veikkaus API retains race data for approximately 10 days only.  
To build a sufficiently large training dataset, run the scraper periodically.

### Run the scraper


This appends new race data to `ravit_opetusdata.json`.

---

## Model Training

From the `model-learning` directory:

```bash
node model
```

This trains the mixed LSTM + Dense model.

---

## Deploying the Trained Model to the Front-End

After training:

1. Copy `mappings.json`  
   → to `front-end/public`

2. Copy `model_full.json`  
   from `ravimalli-mixed/`  
   → to `front-end/public/ravimalli-mixed`

---

## Running the Front-End

From the `front-end` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```
